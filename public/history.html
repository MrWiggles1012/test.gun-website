  <h2>G|u|N Clan History – From Origins to Legacy (2003–2025)</h2>
  <p>
    From a humble fusion of two friend-led clans in 2003, G|u|N (Global Unified Networks)
    rose to become the most respected rifle-only Medal of Honor: Spearhead clan in history.
    Through highs and lows, legendary players, unforgettable clan wars, internal challenges,
    and community rebuilding, G|u|N has remained a symbol of loyalty, tradition, and elite skill.
    As of 2025, after 23 years of Spearhead’s legacy, G|u|N still stands strong — as the last
    great rifle-only clan, and as a true digital home for all Spearhead fans at
    <strong style="color: #FFD700;">gunclan.org</strong>.
  </p>

  <div class="accordion">
    <!-- 2003–2005 -->

        <span class="accordion-title">2003–2005: Birth of a Brotherhood</span>
      </button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
          Before G|u|N, there were two separate clans: Kiwi Alliance (led by Che-Viveand) and
          Mexican Melee Army (led by Mariachi). Real-life friends, the two leaders merged their
          forces to create a new clan: Ka-mma. It was during this period that they encountered a
          rising legend: Silent. With a unique and unmatched playing style, Silent was challenged
          to take on the entire Ka-mma clan by himself — and shockingly, he defeated every single
          member with ease, showcasing a skill level far beyond expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Silent’s performance left the founders in awe, and four months later, he was promoted
          to co-leader. He revolutionized the clan’s infrastructure: building its first website,
          launching real servers, and implementing tools like Xfire, MSN, and TeamSpeak.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2004, Silent formed the EFF (Elite Fighting Force) — an elite squad of 10 out of 80
          members, each proving their worth with a 35–1 kill ratio. Ka-mma dominated clan wars,
          becoming infamous across the community.
        </p>
        <p>
          By April 2005, Che-Viveand and Mariachi, the original founders of Ka-mma, decided to
          retire from leadership. Silent renamed the clan to G|u|N (Global Unified Networks).
          Expansion into Europe began that July, led by European founder Flamewar. He formed the
          F!A (Flames Immortal Army), recruiting skilled rifle-only players across the continent.
          This marked the birth of a new international era.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nine founders laid the foundation: Silent, Sgt Slaughter, Flamewar, Fire, Big Daddy,
          Spaceman, Dahh, Danh, and Ottoziggy.

      </button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
          In 2006, founder Danh introduced new rules and ranks. The clan experimented with
          Battlefield 2 and Counter-Strike: Source. While BF2 didn’t gain traction, CSS flourished
          with near-nightly activity and recruitment.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2007, BF2 was dropped. G|u|N Europe launched its Rifle-Only Spearhead server. Flame
          and Crawford spearheaded recruitment and server population. Players like Kami, Shini,
          and Union joined. Flame promoted Crawford to clan leader for his loyalty and skill. The
          F!A held its first scrims (notably vs. RCR) and saw heavy European presence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, G|u|N USA showed signs of slowing down, with leaders going inactive. But the
          global structure and website held firm.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

      </button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
          2008 began with G|u|N USA launching its first COD4 server. F!A created its official
          website. Union and Shawn were promoted to lead Europe and USA, respectively. Shawn helped
          launch a USA Rifle-Only server and led new squads. But both leaders would later resign.
        </p>
        <p>
          Primoz, Catgirl, and Zezo joined and became future veterans. Recruitment surged so high
          that doors had to be temporarily closed. The F!A won over 120 clan wars that year.
        </p>
        <p>
          In November, G|u|N USA partnered with |LoE| to run COD4/COD5 servers under joint tags.
          The clan upgraded from TeamSpeak to Ventrilo, and training systems were formalized under
          leaders like Jorma.
        </p>

      </button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
          2009 opened with F!A kicking inactive members. Undead was tasked with recruitment while
          Crawford took a break. In February, G|u|N won 1st place in a major MOH community
          tournament (Undead, Union, sub: Primoz).
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet soon after, Undead left to form his own clan, taking others with him. This fracture
          marked the “Dreadful Famine” — one of G|u|N’s darkest times.
        </p>
        <p>
          In June, Flamewar promoted Kamikaze to help restore order. Recruitment was low. Then, a
          turning point: Crawford returned. He restructured the entire clan hierarchy and began
          healing divisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, G|u|N USA collapsed. Their site and servers were shut down due to costs and
          inactivity. Founders like Sgt tried to keep it afloat, but the USA era ended.
        </p>
        <p>
          At year’s end, top members like Shini, Primoz, and Google were honored for loyalty.
          Crawford promised 2010 would be a better year.
        </p>

      </button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
          2010 opened with tragedy: 80+ war records were lost from the site. Crawford launched a new
          rifle-only league, but it was canceled mid-season due to other clans dropping out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recruitment was slow. Crawford later resigned in August, feeling unable to revive the
          clan. Still, veterans remained loyal.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2011, most members stayed in touch via Xfire and Facebook. Flame and Kami played World
          of Tanks, while others drifted to COD or MW2. At year’s end, Crawford rejoined,
          determined to rebuild.

      </button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
          2012 began with a new website, a popular Stalingrad rifle-only server, and the arrival of
          ex-Victus clan members – like Appelpitje, Vaccie, Sniper, Bulent, and 1manArmy. Multiple
          servers were launched, including Zombie mod and “Steal the Beers.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Appel became a clan leader. Sniper became war arranger. Bully broke a kill record, later
          shattered by Crawford with 2,700+ kills in 17 hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          But trouble came. Crawford promoted Atticus and Tilly to leaders, a decision he would
          deeply regret. Along with Dragan, they abused admin powers and divided the clan.
          Eventually, they left to form their own clan, causing further tension.
        </p>
        <p>
          G|u|N officially cut ties with the new [f] clan after repeated conflicts. The leadership
          was reorganized. Appel briefly retired; Matador became war arranger; Vaccie became clan
          leader. G|u|N played 61 official matches that year, with strong win stats.
        </p>
        <p>
          Friendships with AGB and TIP clans flourished. In November, Crawford moved to England and
          had a break from clan activity; Appelpitje assumed full leadership.

      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
          In 2015, G|u|N turned 10 years old. The MOH League was launched, with 8 clans competing.
          G|u|N placed 4th. Appel and Crawford ran the league, even if Crawford didn’t play.
        </p>
        <p>
          Longtime members like Catgirl, Vaccie, Sniper, and new faces like Chaoz kept the clan
          going. Xenon replaced Matador as war arranger.
        </p>
        <p>
          By 2014, Gamespy shut down, removing server browser access. The community shrank. Appel
          and others helped build a new launcher tool for players to find servers.
        </p>
        <p>
          2015 saw continued decline in active players. But the clan site was rebuilt again by Appel
          and Crawford. Crawford returned after a 3-year break. The community was small but alive.

          Although most rival clans faded, G|u|N held on. Its site and servers stayed online.
          Forums remained active, with members joining public servers, scheduling matches, and
          preserving clan memories.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2017, G|u|N organized the MOH Spearhead League — a nostalgic and meaningful event that
          reconnected many long-time members and rival clans. Though smaller in scale than earlier
          years, it served as a heartfelt reminder of G|u|N’s enduring presence and commitment to
          the Spearhead community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through the 2020s, the clan focused less on competition and more on preserving MOHAA
          Spearhead as a cultural cornerstone. A powerful truth became clear: no one who has ever
          loved Spearhead truly leaves for good. Whether taking a long break or just a short one,
          every player eventually feels the pull — the nostalgic rush of the battlefield, the
          spirit of the classics.
        </p>
        <p>
          MOHAA has become a timeless piece of shooter history, a classic that stands tall among
          the greatest in the genre. For those who have ever loved it, the feeling never fades —
          whether you’re a returning veteran or a newcomer discovering its charm, that battlefield
          nostalgia always calls you back. Everyone who plays it eventually finds themselves
          returning, even after long breaks. It’s that emotional bond, that thrill of the past,
          that brings us all back together.
        </p>
        <p>
          As of 2025 — 23 years after the game’s release — G|u|N remains the last major rifle-only
          clan alive. To honor that legacy and offer Spearhead fans a true home, we’ve launched
          <strong>gunclan.org</strong> — our site and forums built as a lasting haven for players
          across the world. It’s more than a clan website; it’s our digital homeland. A place where
          anyone who ever felt the rush of Spearhead can come back, reconnect, and belong again.
          Whether you’re seeking old friends, new battles, or simply that classic MOHAA feeling —
          this is home.
